# Home-automation-with-RPI-Adafruit
Simple Home-Automation using Raspberry pi and Adafruit.

Hey, Guys!
What you need to do is create an account on https://io.adafruit.com/
Create Mqtt triggers on the website and connect it onto the codeofhome.py by providing your key and username,
subscribe to the feeds you have created, manipulate the gpio pins, set up if-else statements as you wish, and have fun!
also for connecting your adafruit to google home and alexa use IFTTT clint.
and as for security feed inside the code, it happened by connecting ultrasonic-sensor to Arduino UNO and using uno as a slave to the raspberry pi.

This is a very basic project, I'll be uploading soon about how to connect master RPI with multiple nodemcu as slaves and connect them via MQTT broker. 
Hope to see ya'll soon!!.
