Hey, Guys!
What you need to do is create an accound on https://io.adafruit.com/
Create Mqtt triggres on the website and connect it onto the codeofhome.py by providing your key and username,
subscribe to the feeds you have created manipulate the gpio pins, set up if else statments as you wish, and have fun!
also for connecting your adafruit to google home and alexa use IFTTT clint.
and as for security feed inside the code, it happend by connecting ultrasonic-sensor to arduino uno and using uno as slave to raspberry pi.

This is a very basic project, I'll be uploading soon about how to connect master RPI with multipal nodemcu as slaves and connect them via 
mqtt broker. 
Hope to see ya'll soon!!.
